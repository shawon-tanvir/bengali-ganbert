#Steps to Run the GAN-BERT model

1. Open the Data_Process_GAN_BERT.ipynb file from this repository and prepare your data for the model.
2. You need to prepare 3 different tsv files (labeled, unlabeled and test) for training and evaluate the model.
3. Then open the GANBERT_pytorch.ipynb file and train and evaluate your model. 
4. You need to change the model_name to use different BERT models from huggingface.
